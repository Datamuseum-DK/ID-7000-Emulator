# ID-7000-Emulator
DDE ID-7000 emulator


This is the repository for an ID-7000 emulator.

There is currently no documentation for this project. However,
the structure and methodologies used here are identical to
what what used for the Q1 emulator for which quite a lot of
documentation exist.

Please see https://q1-lite-emulator.readthedocs.io/ for now.
